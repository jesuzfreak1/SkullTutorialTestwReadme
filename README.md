# SkullTutorialTestwReadme

## Introduction

This tutorial will cover the mechanical, electrical, and software build so that you can create an animatronic skull that uses 8 servos, all run from a single 8-bit microcontroller. We will be using the PIC16F18855 chip on Microchip's Xpress development board:

Because the board does not contain enough independent PWM modules to run the number of servos, this tutorial show a novel method of creating an 8th independent PWM signal on a chip that currently contains only 7. I also include my BOM and Schematic for the electronics as well as instructions for fabrication of the skull. Let's get started!

## Building the Skull

First, let's cover getting the skull built.
