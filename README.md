# SkullTutorialTestwReadme

## Introduction

This tutorial will cover the mechanical, electrical, and software build so that you can create an animatronic skull that uses 8 servos, all run from a single 8-bit microcontroller. We will be using the PIC16F18855 chip on Microchip's Xpress development board. 


This tutorial show a novel method of creating an 8th independent PWM signal on a chip that currently contains only 7, as well as giving you a jumping off point for how to build the skull.
